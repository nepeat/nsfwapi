# porNO

por**NO** is a joke web API that classifies images as porn if they have been posted on pornographic subreddits. This app utilizes the pHash method of [ImageHash](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash) to hash images in a Cassandra database.

Actual code that actually brings this joke concept to life is soon to come.
